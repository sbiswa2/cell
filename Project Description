Cell has a great evolutionary history and all living organism (intelligent/non-intelligent) are based on one or more of them. 
Basically they are the only living units on this planet Earth, and all other living organism, can be thought of as a careful
collection of these units. So exploring these units on how to xform into hardware level modelling is the goal of this project.

This project will try to mimic a basic cell structure starting from(but not limited to)
1. Nucleus
2. cytoplasm
3. Nuclear membrane
4. Other protein synthesis and processing parts
